| **Branch Manager** | Review and adjust transactions. |
| **Inventory Controller** | Monitor product usage and deductions. |
| **Franchise Owner / System Admin** | Access all branch billing reports. |

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Functional Requirements

#### 1. Transaction Creation
- Start new billing session linked to:
  - Appointment ID (if applicable)
  - Client ID
  - Branch
- **Separate Transactions**: Services and products are processed as separate transactions:
  - **Service Transaction**: Services rendered (from appointment or selected manually)
  - **Product Transaction**: Products sold with inventory deduction
- Add line items with quantity and price
- Auto-fetch stylist commission (if applicable).

#### 2. Discounts & Loyalty Points
- **Service Transactions**: No discounts or loyalty points applied (pure service charges)
- **Product Transactions**: Apply:
  - Fixed amount or percentage discounts.
  - Loyalty/reward point redemption.
- Update client points after transaction completion.

#### 3. Payment Handling
- Record payment method:
  - Cash
  - Credit/Debit (record only, no gateway)
  - Gift voucher
- Mark as ‚ÄúPaid‚Äù, ‚ÄúPending‚Äù, or ‚ÄúCancelled‚Äù.

#### 4. Digital Receipts
- Generate PDF receipt with:
  - Salon branding
  - Client info
  - Services/products breakdown
  - Taxes, discounts, and totals
- Save receipt in Firestore under `/receipts/{receiptId}`.
- Option to print or email to client.

#### 5. Integration with Inventory
- **Service Transactions**: No inventory deduction (services don't consume physical products)
- **Product Transactions**: On billing completion:
  - Deduct consumed product quantities.
  - Log deductions in `/inventory_logs`.

#### 6. Refunds / Voiding
- Allow managers to void or refund transactions.
- Maintain audit trail of refunded items.

#### 7. Transaction Separation Logic
- **Service Transactions**:
  - Pure service charges (haircut, styling, etc.)
  - No discounts or loyalty points applied
  - No inventory deduction
  - Linked to appointments and stylists
  - `transactionType: "service"`
  
- **Product Transactions**:
  - Physical product sales (shampoo, conditioner, etc.)
  - Discounts and loyalty points applied
  - Inventory deduction required
  - `transactionType: "product"`

#### 8. Reporting Data
- Store summarized transaction records for daily sales reports.
- Separate reporting for service vs product sales.
- Link to branch analytics and dashboard modules.
