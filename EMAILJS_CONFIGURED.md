# ✅ EmailJS Configuration Complete!

Your EmailJS credentials have been added to `.env`:

```env
VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=service_david_devs
VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=template_j6ktzo1
VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=nuqGoYtoFwXuCTNpv
```

## 🚀 Next Steps:

### 1. Restart Your Dev Server
```bash
# Stop your current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

### 2. Verify It's Working
After restarting, check the browser console. You should see:
- ✅ `EmailJS initialized with public key` (instead of the warning)

### 3. Test Email Sending
1. Go to Branch Manager → Promotions
2. Create a new promotion
3. Check "Email to Clients"
4. Create the promotion
5. Check your email inbox! 📧

## 📋 What You Have:
- ✅ Service ID: `service_david_devs`
- ✅ Template ID: `template_j6ktzo1`
- ✅ Public Key: `nuqGoYtoFwXuCTNpv`

## ⚠️ Note About Private Key:
You mentioned a "Private key" - that's not needed for client-side EmailJS. We only use the **Public Key** for sending emails from the browser.

## 🎉 You're All Set!

After restarting your server, emails will be sent when you create promotions with "Email to Clients" checked!
