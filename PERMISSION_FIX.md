# Permission Fix for Appointments Display

## Problem
The appointments were being found in the database but were being rejected due to permission checks. The console showed:
```
Query executed, found 1 documents
Processing appointment: Q9qNCMcWTGJrf7mFJ0sb Object
Checking view permissions: Object
Appointment rejected due to permissions
Final appointments array: Array(0)
```

## Root Cause
The `appointmentApiService.getAppointments()` method was being called without the proper user role and user ID parameters, causing the permission check to fail.

## Solution
Updated the frontend call to pass the correct user role and user ID to the appointment service.

### **Before (Problem):**
```javascript
const result = await appointmentApiService.getAppointments({
  branchId: branchId
});
```

### **After (Fixed):**
```javascript
const result = await appointmentApiService.getAppointments({
  branchId: branchId
}, userData.roles && userData.roles.length > 0 ? userData.roles[0] : 'branchManager', userData.uid);
```

## Key Changes Made

### **1. Added User Role Parameter** âœ…
- **Extracts** the user's role from `userData.roles[0]`
- **Falls back** to `'branchManager'` if no role found
- **Uses** the correct role name from the roles constants

### **2. Added User ID Parameter** âœ…
- **Passes** the user's UID (`userData.uid`)
- **Enables** proper permission checking
- **Allows** the service to verify user access

### **3. Proper Role Handling** âœ…
- **Handles** the `roles` array structure (plural)
- **Extracts** the primary role from the array
- **Uses** the correct role constant format

## Permission Logic

### **Branch Manager Permissions:**
The appointment service allows branch managers to view appointments in their branch:
```javascript
// Branch admin and manager can view appointments in their branch
if ([ROLES.BRANCH_ADMIN, ROLES.BRANCH_MANAGER].includes(userRole)) {
  return true; // Will be filtered by branch in query
}
```

### **Required Parameters:**
- **User Role**: `'branchManager'` (from roles constants)
- **User ID**: The logged-in user's UID
- **Branch ID**: The user's branch ID for filtering

## Result

Now when you load the appointments page:
- âœ… **Permission check passes** with correct user role and ID
- âœ… **Appointments are displayed** from your branch
- âœ… **Proper access control** is maintained
- âœ… **Data security** is ensured

The appointments should now display correctly since the permission check will pass with the proper user role and ID! ðŸŽ‰

## Console Output (Expected)
```
Query executed, found 1 documents
Processing appointment: Q9qNCMcWTGJrf7mFJ0sb Object
Checking view permissions: Object
Appointment approved for viewing
Final appointments array: Array(1)
```

Your appointments should now be visible on the page! ðŸŽ‰
