   - `updateAppointment` - Update existing appointments  
   - `getAppointments` - Retrieve with filtering
   - `getAppointmentById` - Get specific appointment
   - `cancelAppointment` - Cancel appointments
   - `completeAppointment` - Mark as completed

2. **Enhanced Appointment Service** (`src/services/appointmentService.js`)
   - Updated to handle your exact data structure
   - Support for new vs existing clients
   - Client information management
   - History tracking
   - Status management

3. **Data Validation Service** (`src/services/appointmentValidationService.js`)
   - Complete validation for all fields
   - Data sanitization
   - Error handling
   - Support for your exact structure

4. **Appointment Model** (`src/models/AppointmentModel.js`)
   - Structured data handling
   - Helper methods for display
   - Status management
   - History tracking
   - Validation

5. **API Service** (`src/services/appointmentApiService.js`)
   - Client-side integration
   - Complete CRUD operations
   - Search and filtering
   - Statistics and reporting
