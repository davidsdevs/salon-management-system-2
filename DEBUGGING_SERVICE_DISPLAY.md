# Debugging Service Display Issues

## Problem
The appointments are not showing:
- Service names (showing IDs instead)
- Stylist names (showing IDs instead)  
- Estimated totals (not calculating correctly)

## Debugging Added

### **1. Appointment Data Logging**
```javascript
console.log('Appointments data:', result.appointments);
```
- Shows the raw appointment data being fetched
- Helps verify if serviceStylistPairs are present

### **2. ID Extraction Logging**
```javascript
console.log('Extracted stylist IDs:', stylistIds);
console.log('Extracted service IDs:', serviceIds);
```
- Shows which stylist and service IDs are being extracted
- Helps verify if the extraction logic is working

### **3. Data Fetching Logging**
```javascript
console.log('Fetched stylists:', stylistsInfo);
console.log('Fetched services:', servicesInfo);
```
- Shows the stylist and service data being fetched
- Helps verify if the database calls are working

### **4. Helper Function Logging**
```javascript
console.log('Getting service name for:', serviceId, 'Available services:', servicesData);
console.log('Getting stylist name for:', stylistId, 'Available stylists:', stylistsData);
```
- Shows what data is available when helper functions are called
- Helps verify if the data is being passed correctly

## What to Check

### **1. Console Output**
When you load the page, check the console for:
- **Appointments data**: Should show your appointment with serviceStylistPairs
- **Extracted IDs**: Should show the stylist and service IDs from your appointment
- **Fetched data**: Should show the stylist and service information
- **Helper function calls**: Should show what data is available

### **2. Expected Console Output**
Based on your data structure, you should see:
```
Appointments data: [{
  id: "Q9qNCMcWTGJrf7mFJ0sb",
  serviceStylistPairs: [
    { serviceId: "service_beard", stylistId: "1qOi4iF1YJOad3eEY7aiqZhxpYf1" },
    { serviceId: "service_facial", stylistId: "4gf5AOdy4HffVillOmLu68ABgrb2" }
  ],
  // ... other fields
}]

Extracted stylist IDs: ["1qOi4iF1YJOad3eEY7aiqZhxpYf1", "4gf5AOdy4HffVillOmLu68ABgrb2"]
Extracted service IDs: ["service_beard", "service_facial"]

Fetched stylists: {
  "1qOi4iF1YJOad3eEY7aiqZhxpYf1": {
    name: "Gwyneth Cruz",
    role: "stylist",
    // ... other fields
  }
}

Fetched services: {
  "service_beard": {
    name: "Beard Trim",
    price: 200,
    // ... other fields
  },
  "service_facial": {
    name: "Facial Treatment", 
    price: 500,
    // ... other fields
  }
}
```

## Possible Issues

### **1. Data Not Being Fetched**
If you see empty objects `{}` for stylists or services:
- Check if the serviceService is working
- Check if the userService is working
- Check if the IDs are correct

### **2. IDs Not Being Extracted**
If you see empty arrays `[]` for stylist or service IDs:
- Check if the appointment data has serviceStylistPairs
- Check if the extraction logic is working

### **3. Helper Functions Not Working**
If you see fallback names being used:
- Check if the servicesData and stylistsData are populated
- Check if the helper functions are being called correctly

## Next Steps

1. **Load the page** and check the console output
2. **Share the console output** so I can see what's happening
3. **Identify the issue** based on the debugging information
4. **Fix the specific problem** that's preventing the data from displaying

The debugging will help us identify exactly where the issue is occurring in the data flow! üîç
