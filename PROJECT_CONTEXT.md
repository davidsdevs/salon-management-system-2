## 1. PROJECT OVERVIEW

Davidâ€™s Salon operates multiple branches, each managing appointments, inventory, and staff independently.  
This decentralized structure creates inefficiencies, inconsistent reporting, and limited managerial visibility.

The **Davidâ€™s Salon Management System (DSMS)** will centralize operations across all branches through a **cloud-based platform powered by Firebase**.  
It will streamline workflows, improve customer experience, and provide actionable insights for management, ensuring consistency, efficiency, and scalability.
