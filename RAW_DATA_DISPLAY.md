# Raw Data Display Implementation

## What I've Done

I've simplified the appointments display to show **ALL raw data** from the appointments collection, including IDs, so you can see exactly what data is available and guide me on how to normalize it properly.

## ✅ Changes Made

### **1. Added Debug Section** 
- **Raw JSON Display**: Shows the complete appointment data structure
- **First Appointment**: Displays the raw data from the first appointment
- **Easy to Read**: Formatted JSON for easy inspection

### **2. Updated Services Column**
**Before**: Tried to show normalized service names
**After**: Shows raw service data
```javascript
Service-Stylist Pairs:
├── Service ID: service_beard
├── Stylist ID: 1qOi4iF1YJOad3eEY7aiqZhxpYf1
├── Service ID: service_facial  
└── Stylist ID: 4gf5AOdy4HffVillOmLu68ABgrb2
```

### **3. Updated Stylist Column**
**Before**: Tried to show stylist names
**After**: Shows raw stylist data
```javascript
Stylist Info:
├── Stylist ID: N/A (or actual ID if exists)
└── Service-Stylist Pairs:
    ├── • 1qOi4iF1YJOad3eEY7aiqZhxpYf1 (service_beard)
    └── • 4gf5AOdy4HffVillOmLu68ABgrb2 (service_facial)
```

### **4. Updated Revenue Column**
**Before**: Tried to show calculated totals
**After**: Shows raw revenue data
```javascript
Revenue Info:
├── Calculated Total: ₱700
├── Service Count: 2
└── Raw Service Data:
    ├── • service_beard = ₱200
    └── • service_facial = ₱500
```
